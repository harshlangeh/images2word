# Image to Word Document Generator

If you have multiple images in a folder and want to create a Word file containing all the images with their file names as titles, this script simplifies the process. It uses Node.js and the `docx` library to generate a `.docx` file. Simply specify the folder path containing your images, and the script will create a Word document with each image preceded by its file name as a title.

## Steps:
1. Set the folder path in `index.js`. [folderPath]
2. Execute the script with `node index.js`.
